### When to Finalize (Gas Optimization)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Best Times">
    Finalize during low Ethereum gas periods:
    
    - 🌙 **Late night** (2-6 AM US Eastern)
    - 📅 **Weekends** (Saturday-Sunday)
    - 🏖️ **Holidays**
    
    **Potential savings:** 50-70% on L1 gas
    
    Example:
    - High gas (100 gwei): $30 finalization
    - Low gas (20 gwei): $10 finalization
    - **Savings: $20**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Gas Monitoring">
    **Check gas before finalizing:**
    
    1. Visit https://etherscan.io/gastracker
    2. Look at current gas price:
       - ✅ Low (< 30 gwei): Good time
       - 🟡 Medium (30-70 gwei): Acceptable
       - 🔴 High (> 70 gwei): Wait if possible
    
    **You can finalize anytime after 7 days**
    
    No rush - save on gas by waiting for low prices!
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Set Alerts">
    **Get notified when gas is cheap:**
    
    1. Use https://etherscan.io/gastracker
    2. Set up email/SMS alerts
    3. Get notified when gas drops below your threshold
    4. Finalize during the low period
    
    This can save you $10-20 per withdrawal!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel my withdrawal?">
    **No, withdrawals cannot be cancelled** once initiated.
    
    Once you initiate:
    - Your L2 ETH is immediately burned
    - Withdrawal enters 7-day challenge period
    - You must wait and finalize on L1
    
    **Options:**
    - Complete the withdrawal (finalize after 7 days)
    - Once on L1, you can deposit back to L2 if needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Finalize button is disabled / grayed out">
    The 7-day challenge period hasn't completed yet.
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Check "Time Remaining" on bridge interface
    2. Wait until countdown reaches 0
    3. Make sure 7 FULL days have passed
    4. Refresh the page
    
    The button enables exactly 7 days after initiation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Forgot to finalize / Missed the deadline">
    **There is no deadline!**
    
    You can finalize your withdrawal:
    - 7 days after initiation ✅
    - 8 days later ✅
    - 30 days later ✅
    - 1 year later ✅
    
    Your funds are safe in the L1 bridge contract. Finalize whenever you're ready (preferably during low gas periods).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong network when trying to finalize">
    You're connected to L2 instead of L1.
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Open your wallet (MetaMask)
    2. Click network dropdown
    3. Select **"Ethereum Mainnet"** (NOT TeQoin L2)
    4. Return to bridge interface
    5. Finalize button should now work
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Finalization transaction failed">
    **Common reasons:**
    - Insufficient ETH on L1 for gas
    - Gas limit too low
    - Network congestion
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Check error message on Etherscan
    2. Make sure you have ~0.01 ETH on L1
    3. Try again with higher gas limit
    4. Your withdrawal is still safe - just retry
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Don't see my withdrawal on bridge interface">
    **Solutions:**
    
    1. **Wrong wallet:**
       - Make sure you're using the same wallet that initiated
       - Check wallet address matches
    
    2. **Wrong network:**
       - Bridge shows L2 → L1 withdrawals
       - Make sure you're looking at the right direction
    
    3. **Different browser/device:**
       - Withdrawal data is stored in browser cache
       - Use same browser or manually enter TX hash
    
    4. **Clear cache:**
       - Refresh the page
       - Clear browser cache
       - Reconnect wallet
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="ETH not received after finalization">
    Finalized but ETH not in wallet.
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Check finalization transaction on Etherscan
    2. Verify status shows "Success"
    3. Make sure you're on Ethereum L1 network
    4. Refresh wallet (disconnect/reconnect)
    5. Check the correct wallet address
    
    If finalization succeeded, ETH was sent to your address. Check you're viewing the right network and wallet.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## ⏰ Important Timeline Reminders

<Warning>
**Set Multiple Reminders**

Don't forget to finalize your withdrawal!

**Recommended reminders:**
- 📅 6 days after initiation: "Withdrawal ready tomorrow"
- 📅 7 days after initiation: "Withdrawal ready - finalize now"
- 📅 7 days + 1 week: "Finalize withdrawal (no rush, but don't forget)"

**Add to calendar:**
- Calendar app on phone
- Google Calendar with email reminder
- Outlook with notification
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Gas Price Alerts**

Since you can finalize anytime after 7 days:

1. Wait for low gas periods
2. Set up gas price alerts on Etherscan
3. Finalize when notified about low gas
4. Save $10-20 on transaction costs!
</Tip>

## ✅ Post-Withdrawal Checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify L1 Balance">
```bash
    1. Switch to Ethereum Mainnet in wallet
    2. Check balance increased by withdrawal amount
    3. Account for gas fees
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Transaction Records">
```bash
    # Keep these for your records:
    - L2 initiation TX hash
    - L1 finalization TX hash
    - Withdrawal amount
    - Initiation date
    - Finalization date
    - Total time taken
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Records">
    If you track your portfolio:
    - Remove ETH from L2 balance
    - Add ETH to L1 balance
    - Note withdrawal fees for tax purposes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 💡 Best Practices

<Tip>
**Plan Withdrawals 7 Days in Advance**

If you know you'll need ETH on L1:
- Start withdrawal 7 days early
- Don't wait until you urgently need funds
- Withdrawals cannot be expedited
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Keep Some ETH on Both Networks**

Maintain balances on both L1 and L2:
- L1: For mainnet operations and gas
- L2: For low-fee transactions
- Never withdraw everything at once
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Batch Withdrawals**

Instead of many small withdrawals:
- Accumulate ETH on L2
- Withdraw larger amounts less frequently
- Save on L1 finalization fees
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Finalize During Low Gas**

You can wait after the 7-day period:
- Monitor Ethereum gas prices
- Finalize during weekends or late night
- Save 50-70% on finalization costs
</Tip>
