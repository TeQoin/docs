## 🌉 General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the TeQoin bridge?">
    The TeQoin bridge is a set of smart contracts that enables trustless transfer of ETH between Ethereum (L1) and TeQoin L2.
    
    **Key features:**
    - Trustless (secured by smart contracts)
    - 1:1 backing (1 ETH on L1 = 1 ETH on L2)
    - Bidirectional (L1 → L2 and L2 → L1)
    - Secure (fraud proof protected)
    
    [Learn more about the bridge →](/bridge/overview)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is the bridge safe to use?">
    **Yes, the bridge is very safe.**
    
    **Security measures:**
    - ✅ Audited smart contracts
    - ✅ Optimistic rollup security model
    - ✅ 7-day fraud proof protection
    - ✅ Decentralized verification
    - ✅ Open-source code
    
    **Your funds are secured by:**
    - Ethereum L1 smart contracts (battle-tested)
    - Cryptographic proofs
    - Economic incentives for fraud detection
    
    **Best practices:**
    - Only use the official bridge: https://bridge.teqoin.io
    - Verify contract addresses before transactions
    - Start with small amounts to test
    
    [Security model details →](/architecture/security-model)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What can I bridge?">
    **Currently supported:**
    - ✅ ETH (native currency)
    
    **Coming soon:**
    - 🔜 ERC-20 tokens
    - 🔜 ERC-721 NFTs
    - 🔜 ERC-1155 tokens
    
    For now, only ETH can be bridged between L1 and L2.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How much does it cost to bridge?">
    **Deposit (L1 → L2):**
    - L1 Gas: $10-50 (varies with Ethereum gas price)
    - L2 Fee: $0 (covered by bridge)
    - Bridge Fee: $0
    
    **Withdrawal (L2 → L1):**
    - L2 Gas: ~$0.001 (initiate)
    - L1 Gas: $10-30 (finalize, varies with gas price)
    - Bridge Fee: $0
    
    **Total cost:** Mostly Ethereum L1 gas fees
    
    [Cost breakdown →](/bridge/deposit-l1-to-l2#cost-breakdown)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the ratio between L1 and L2 ETH?">
    **1:1 ratio - always!**
    
    - 1 ETH on L1 = 1 ETH on L2
    - 0.5 ETH on L1 = 0.5 ETH on L2
    - No conversion, no fees on the amount
    
    **Example:**
    - Deposit 2.0 ETH from L1
    - Receive 2.0 ETH on L2
    - (minus only gas fees, not deducted from amount)
  </Accordion>

## ⏱️ Timing Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does a deposit take?">
    **Deposit (L1 → L2): ~15 minutes**
    
    **Breakdown:**
    - L1 transaction confirmation: 2-5 minutes
    - L2 processing: 5-10 minutes
    - **Total: 10-15 minutes typically**
    
    **Factors affecting time:**
    - Ethereum network congestion
    - Gas price used (faster gas = faster confirmation)
    - L2 sequencer processing time
    
    [Deposit guide →](/bridge/deposit-l1-to-l2)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does a withdrawal take?">
    **Withdrawal (L2 → L1): 7 days + 15 minutes**
    
    **Breakdown:**
    - Initiate on L2: ~5 seconds
    - Challenge period: 7 days (security feature)
    - Finalize on L1: 2-5 minutes
    - **Total: 7 days, ~15 minutes**
    
    **Why 7 days?**
    
    This is the challenge period for fraud proofs. It's a security feature that ensures your funds are safe.
    
    [Learn about challenge period →](/bridge/challenge-period)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I speed up my withdrawal?">
    **Official bridge: No - 7 days is mandatory for security**
    
    The challenge period cannot be bypassed when using the official bridge.
    
    **Alternative: Third-party fast bridges**
    
    Some services offer "instant" withdrawals:
    - Across Protocol
    - Hop Protocol
    - Connext
    
    **How they work:**
    - You pay a fee (0.1-1%)
    - Liquidity provider gives you L1 ETH immediately
    - They wait 7 days to claim your withdrawal
    
    **Trade-offs:**
    - ✅ Fast (minutes instead of days)
    - ❌ Less secure (trust third party)
    - ❌ Additional fees
    - ❌ May have liquidity limits
    
    <Warning>
    Use third-party bridges at your own risk. Official bridge = safest option.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My deposit is taking longer than 15 minutes. What should I do?">
    **First, check if L1 transaction confirmed:**
    
    1. Go to https://etherscan.io
    2. Paste your transaction hash
    3. Check status
    
    **If L1 still pending:**
    - Wait longer (may take hours if low gas)
    - Consider speeding up (MetaMask "Speed Up")
    
    **If L1 confirmed but not on L2 after 30 minutes:**
    - Wait another 30 minutes
    - Check bridge status: https://status.teqoin.io
    - Refresh wallet (disconnect/reconnect)
    
    **If still missing after 2 hours:**
    - Contact support with transaction hash
    - Check #support on Discord

## 💰 Amount & Limits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there a minimum amount to bridge?">
    **No hard minimum, but recommendations:**
    
    **Deposit (L1 → L2):**
    - Recommended: 0.01 ETH or more
    - Reason: L1 gas fees ($10-50) make smaller amounts uneconomical
    
    **Example:**
    - Bridge 0.001 ETH: Pay $15 gas on $2 transfer (750% fee)
    - Bridge 0.1 ETH: Pay $15 gas on $200 transfer (7.5% fee)
    - Bridge 1 ETH: Pay $15 gas on $2000 transfer (0.75% fee)
    
    **Withdrawal (L2 → L1):**
    - Recommended: 0.05 ETH or more
    - Reason: Must pay L1 finalization fee
    
    **Tip:** Bridge larger amounts less frequently to minimize gas costs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is there a maximum amount to bridge?">
    **No hard maximum, but practical limits:**
    
    **Bridge capacity:**
    - Per transaction: ~1000 ETH (soft limit)
    - Daily: No limit
    
    **For very large amounts (>100 ETH):**
    - Consider splitting into multiple transactions
    - Contact support for assistance
    - Allow extra time for processing
    
    **Security tip:**
    - Test with small amount first
    - Then bridge larger amounts
    - Don't bridge everything at once
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I bridge fractional amounts (e.g., 0.00123 ETH)?">
    **Yes, any amount is supported!**
    
    - ✅ 0.00123 ETH - supported
    - ✅ 0.5 ETH - supported
    - ✅ 1.23456789 ETH - supported
    
    **Precision:** Up to 18 decimals (standard for ETH)
    
    **Note:** Very small amounts may not be economical due to gas fees.

## ❌ Cancellation & Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel a deposit after sending it?">
    **No, deposits cannot be cancelled.**
    
    Once your L1 transaction confirms:
    - ETH is locked in L1 bridge
    - L2 will automatically mint equivalent ETH
    - Process cannot be stopped
    
    **If you want to undo:**
    - Wait for deposit to complete (~15 min)
    - Then withdraw back to L1 (7 days)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel a withdrawal?">
    **No, withdrawals cannot be cancelled.**
    
    Once you initiate withdrawal:
    - L2 ETH is immediately burned
    - Withdrawal enters 7-day challenge period
    - Cannot be reversed
    
    **Options:**
    - Complete the withdrawal (finalize after 7 days)
    - Once on L1, deposit back to L2 if needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if my transaction fails?">
    **If L1 deposit transaction fails:**
    - Your ETH stays in your L1 wallet
    - Nothing was bridged
    - Check error message on Etherscan
    - Retry with correct parameters
    
    **Common reasons:**
    - Insufficient gas
    - Wrong contract address
    - Network congestion
    
    **If L2 withdrawal initiation fails:**
    - Your ETH stays on L2
    - Nothing was withdrawn
    - Check error on explorer.teqoin.io
    - Retry transaction
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I sent ETH directly to the bridge contract without calling the function. Can I get it back?">
    **This depends on how you sent it:**
    
    **If you called depositETH():** ✅ Normal deposit, should process
    
    **If you sent plain ETH transfer:** ⚠️ Funds may be stuck
    
    **What to do:**
    1. Find your transaction hash
    2. Contact support immediately
    3. Provide transaction details
    4. May be recoverable in some cases
    
    **Prevention:**
    - Always use the bridge interface
    - Or call the correct contract function
    - Never send plain ETH transfers

## 💡 Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the best strategy for bridging?">
    **Recommended approach:**
    
    **For deposits (L1 → L2):**
    1. Bridge during low Ethereum gas periods
    2. Bridge larger amounts less frequently
    3. Test with small amount first
    4. Keep some ETH on L1 for future gas
    
    **For withdrawals (L2 → L1):**
    1. Plan 7 days in advance
    2. Initiate withdrawal now if you'll need L1 funds soon
    3. Finalize during low gas periods (save money)
    4. Don't withdraw 100% - keep some on L2
    
    **General:**
    - Maintain balance on both networks
    - Document all transactions
    - Set calendar reminders for finalization
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How can I save on bridge fees?">
    **Gas optimization tips:**
    
    **1. Time your transactions**
    - Bridge on weekends (cheaper gas)
    - Bridge late night US time (2-6 AM EST)
    - Avoid peak hours (weekday afternoons)
    
    **2. Batch your transfers**
    - Instead of: 10 deposits of 0.1 ETH = $100 gas
    - Do: 1 deposit of 1 ETH = $10 gas
    - **Save: $90**
    
    **3. Monitor gas prices**
    - Use https://etherscan.io/gastracker
    - Set up gas price alerts
    - Wait for gas under 30 gwei
    
    **4. For withdrawals**
    - Finalize during low gas periods
    - No rush after 7 days - optimize timing
    - Can save 50-70% on finalization
