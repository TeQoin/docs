## 🚀 Try More Advanced Transactions

Now that you've sent a basic transaction, try these:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Send to Multiple Addresses">
    **Batch Transactions**
    
    Send ETH to multiple recipients in separate transactions:
    
    1. Send 0.01 ETH to Address A
    2. Send 0.02 ETH to Address B
    3. Send 0.03 ETH to Address C
    
    On TeQoin L2, all three transactions will:
    - Confirm in ~15 seconds total
    - Cost minimal fees combined
    
    On Ethereum L1, this would:
    - Take ~45 seconds
    - Cost $30-60 in gas fees
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Interact with a Smart Contract">
    **Call Contract Functions**
    
    Ready to interact with smart contracts?
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Find a Contract">
        Visit the block explorer and find a deployed contract
        
        Or use this test contract:
        `0x5E3A9432a2D6eb0c5D362A0A2F58Bc02Db45850D`
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Connect Wallet">
        Some contracts have web interfaces. Connect your wallet to interact.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Call Functions">
        Try calling read functions (free) or write functions (requires gas)
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Test Transaction Speed">
    **Speed Test Challenge**
    
    See how fast TeQoin really is:
    
    1. Note the current time
    2. Send a transaction
    3. Wait for confirmation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction is pending for a long time">
    TeQoin L2 transactions should confirm in ~5 seconds.
    
    **If stuck on pending:**
    1. Wait 30 seconds
    2. Refresh your wallet
    3. Check the block explorer with your TX hash
    4. Check network status: https://status.teqoin.io
    
    If still pending after 1 minute, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/teqoin) for support.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="'Insufficient funds' error">
    You don't have enough ETH to cover the amount + gas fee.
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Check your balance
    2. Try sending a smaller amount
    3. Get more testnet ETH from the [faucet](/quickstart/get-testnet-eth)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Transaction failed">
    If your transaction shows "Failed" status:
    
    **Common reasons:**
    - Insufficient gas limit (rare on simple transfers)
    - Smart contract execution error (if interacting with contracts)
    - Out of gas
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Check the error message on block explorer
    2. Try the transaction again
    3. If interacting with a contract, check contract documentation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong network - sent on Ethereum instead">
    If you accidentally sent on Ethereum L1:
    
    **Prevention:**
    - Always verify you're on **TeQoin L2** before sending
    - Check the network name in your wallet
    
    **If already sent on L1:**
    - Your ETH is safe, just on the wrong network
    - Switch to Ethereum L1 in your wallet to see it
    - Use the [bridge](/bridge/deposit-l1-to-l2) to move it to TeQoin L2
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Recipient didn't receive ETH">
    If the recipient says they didn't receive the ETH:
    
    **Check:**
    1. View transaction on block explorer - does it show "Success"?
    2. Did you send to the correct address?
    3. Is the recipient checking the right network (TeQoin L2)?
    
    If transaction succeeded, the ETH was delivered. Recipient needs to:
    - Switch to TeQoin L2 network in their wallet
    - Refresh their wallet
  </Accordion>

## 💡 Pro Tips

<Tip>
**Test First:** Always send a small test transaction first when sending to a new address. Once confirmed, send the larger amount.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Save TX Hashes:** Keep a record of important transaction hashes. You can always look them up later on the block explorer.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Bookmark the Explorer:** Add https://explorer.teqoin.io to your bookmarks for quick transaction lookups.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Same Address Everywhere:** Your wallet address is the same on Ethereum L1, TeQoin L2, and all EVM chains. The ETH just lives on different networks!
</Tip>

**Transaction successful?** You're now ready to [bridge real assets](/quickstart/bridge-assets) or [deploy contracts](/developers/deploy-contract)! 🚀
